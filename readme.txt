[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds the ability to perform continuous actions without holding down the mouse key IF you hold a hotkey before starting the action.

You can re-bind the hotkey in the settings menu - by default it's left CTRL.

This one is for my fellow gamers who suffer from repetitive strain injury from mining a few too many rocks in DayZ (and RuneScape) over the years.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
